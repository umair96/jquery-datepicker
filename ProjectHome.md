The datePicker is a flexible unobtrusive plugin for the jQuery library which simplifies the task of entering dates into HTML forms (or any other places).

Designed to be flexible and easily extensible it comes with many different examples of it's usage.

The latest version will always be found in the subversion repository or on my site:

(the version in the download section is the latest release version but will normally lag behind the newest code)
